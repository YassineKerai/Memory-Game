        <p class="about">
            It's a classic game where players flip over pairs of cards, trying to find matching pairs. The cards are
            usually
            laid out face down in a grid, and on each turn, a player flips over two cards. If the cards match, the
            player
            keeps the pair and gets another turn. If they don't match, the cards are flipped back over, and the next
            player
            takes their turn. The goal is to remember the positions of the cards and match all pairs in the fewest
            number of
            turns or the shortest amount of time.
